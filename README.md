# Lego IP's cost

How much does the customer pays for a non-Lego licensed theme? In this project we will answer this question. To do that, I spoke to the folks at Brickset if they could pass me the database of all Lego sets that were released on 2020, and they kindly gave it to me. Thanks again Brickset!

The project was done using Collab notebooks from Google. To run the collab, you must download the lego2020.csv file, upload it to the root folder of the notebook and run all the cells.
